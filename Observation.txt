1st model:
Convolution layer 1: In-Channel=1 , Out-Channel=6 , kernel-Size=5 , padding = 0
Convolution layer 2: In-Channel=6 , Out-Channel=16 , kernel-Size=5 , padding = 0
Maxpooling dimension:2x2
Fixed Convolution layer 1:In-feature=256 , Out-feature=4
Fixed Convolution layer 2:In-feature=4 , Out-feature=30*84
Fixed Convolution layer 3:In-feature=30*84 , Out-feature=10

Observation:
Usage of different optimizer gives different level of accuracy and different loses
When Adam optimizer is used ,it gives accuracy of :82.37%
When SGD optimizer is used , it gives accuracy of :84.82%
But there is no big differnce in changing the loss function.

2nd model:
Convolution layer 1: In-Channel=1 , Out-Channel=32 , kernel-Size=3 , padding = 1
Convolution layer 2: In-Channel=32 , Out-Channel=64 , kernel-Size=3 , padding = 0
Maxpooling dimension:2x2
Fixed Convolution layer 1:In-feature=64*6*6 , Out-feature=600
Fixed Convolution layer 2:In-feature=600 , Out-feature=120
Fixed Convolution layer 3:In-feature=120 , Out-feature=10

Observation:
By changing the model , it effect the accuracy score.If the model is not selected
perfectly then accuracy can be decreased.
So , with this model ,accuracy with Adam optimizer is:89.51%
and with SGD accuracy is:88.57%
Changing model also effect the training time ;
In this model , training time is really large as compared to previous model,
though the accuracy is increased.

In both the model,with increase in epoch value ,loss is decreased and the accuracy is 
increased.
After increasing epoch value to 4 ,accuracy with Adam optimizer is:89.92%
